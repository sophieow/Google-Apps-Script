// Every minute it checks the calendar. If an event has been declined, it then checks if that event is within a certain amount of hours, so if the event is declined on short notice, it notifies the candidate whose email is in the subject line. It triggers an auto-send email informing them of the cancellation. It takes the interview event ID and moves it to a list of interview cancellations have already been sent out. For all future notifications, it makes sure it hasn't already sent one out by comparing two arrays.
